----------------------------------------------------------------------



You will find the documentation in JADAMILU/Doc/ (a userguide giving
additional information to the CPC paper referred above).

In JADAMILU/Doc/DPJD_prototype.f (resp. SPJD_prototype.f, CPJD_prototype.f,
ZPJD_prototype.f) you will find for your information a copy of the source of the
main driver routines, that is, of the routines your application program may call
to use JADAMILU. 

The user guide refers to several examples. The related sources are located
in JADAMILU/samples/

The file JADAMILU/Doc/DPJD_prototype.f (resp. SPJD_prototype.f, CPJD_prototype.f,
ZPJD_prototype.f) is only given to you for illustration purpose. All routines and
subroutines have been precompiled for you and stored in a library 
JADAMILU/lib/ArchComp/libjadamilu.a , where ArchComp reflects the 
architecture of the processor, the operating system, the storage mode 
for integers and the compiler you plan to use, according the table at 
the bottom of this README file.



building the library
--------------------

To build the JADAMILU library, go to the JADAMILU/src directory and modify
"user.mk" in order to set up your most favoured compiler and architecture
according the table at the bottom of this README file. After that, type "make".
JADAMILU will compute the library "libjadamilu.a" which will be located at
JADAMILU/lib/ArchComp/.

Before you compile any sample code, you need to get the AMD library which is
part of SuiteSparse library of Tim Davis (Texas A&M UNiversity). Downloading and
compiling the SuiteSparse library will also provide libraries "libamd.a" and
"libsuitesparseconfig.a" (These are typically located in some subdirectory such
as SuiteSparse/AMD/Lib/ and SuiteSparse/SuiteSparse_config/). You could copy
these libraries (for simplicity) to JADAMILU/lib/ArchComp/ or refer differently
to them.

Furthermore you need your own BLAS and LAPACK library. Simple precompiled F77
sources are could be used, but these are likely to be slow. You better use some
vendor-specific libraries which highly optimized (if in doubt, ask your system
administrator for details).


Last but not least you need to get MC64 and MC21 from the HSL Mathematical
Software Library (https://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/). For copyrights, terms of use, etc.,
we kindly refer to read carefully the their conditions and make sure that they
apply to you. You could compile these sources in the same way as the library has
been built including options for long integer, position independent code, memory
model, "-c" etc. Then copy the object files MC*.o to  JADAMILU/lib/ArchComp/
For example, if you are using the GNU compiler and you want to use 64 bit
long integer, then use a command such as
> gfortran -O -fPIC -m64 -fdefault-integer-8 -mcmodel=medium -c MC64D.f
This refers to the INT64YGNU option

If you are using 32 bit integer in large memory space use
> gfortran -O -fPIC -m64 -mcmodel=medium -c MC64D.f
This refers to the INT64NGNU option

If you have no special requirements, simply use
> gfortran -O -fPIC -c MC64D.f
This refers to the INT32GNU option

Other compilers and options are treated accordingly. You may take a look at
JADAMILU/src/makefiles for some suggestions.



compiling the main program
--------------------------

To compile any program using JADAMILU, for instance the examples in
JADAMILU/samples/ , go to the directory where the program is 
located and use the command

> mycompiler OPTIONS myprog.f -L ../lib/ArchComp -ljadamilu -lamd -lsuitesparseconfig -llapack -lblas ../lib/ArchComp/MC*.o

where mycompiler stands for the Fortran compiler matching ArchComp.  
For instance, if you have an Intel processor with 32 bit architecture
and use gfortran compiler, EXAMPLE1.f will be compiled with

> gfortran EXAMPLE1.f  -L ../lib/INT32GNU -ljadamilu -lamd -lsuitesparseconfig -llapack -lblas ../lib/INT32GNU/MC*.o

Similarly, 
> gfortran -m64 -fdefault-integer-8 -mcmodel=medium EXAMPLE1.f  -L ../lib/INT64NGNU -ljadamilu -lamd -lsuitesparseconfig -llapack -lblas ../lib/INT64NGNU/MC*.o
would refer to long address space and 64 bit long integer

Of course, you may insert your favorite options, like "-O" for optimization
or "-o myprog" so that the executable has name "myprog" instead of a.out

Note that if the compiler suite contains a Fortran 90 compiler, 
mycompiler may be this Fortran 90 compiler and myprog may have 
extension .f90 ; for instance, with pgf:

> pgf90 myprog.f90  -L ../lib/ArchComp -ljadamilu -lamd -lsuitesparseconfig -llapack -lblas ../lib/ArchComp/MC*.o

Of course, these are simple examples. JADAMILU may also be used in complex
applications with programs split in several files and possibly built
with makefile. It is easy to deduce how to proceed from the examples
above, in particular how to adapt possible Makefile



Compiling the CMEX interfaces for MATLAB
----------------------------------------
go to the subdirectory JADAMILU/matlabsrc and type "make".
After that, you will find in the subdirectory JADAMILU/matlab the associated
binaries (which have an ending like *.mex*) along with JADAMILU's two
MATLAB drivers "PJDinit.m", which is used to init your parameters to the
default values and "PJD.m" which is JADAMILU's eigensolver call. "PJD.m"
is set up along the MATLAB "eigs" function. There are two sample codes
"example1.m" and "example2.m" which demonstrate the usage of PJDinit and PJD

TABLE of ArchComp
-----------------

To know your OS, enter
> uname -o

To know your processor, ask your system administrator or check the Website
describing your system confifuration.

To know whether your system use 32 or 64 bit addressing, type
> uname -p
If the answer ends with _64, you have 64 bit addressing, otherwise 32.

When your processor use 64 bit addressing, you may use long integer
(integer*8, i.e., 64 bit integer) in your application; 
sometimes this is done with the -i8 option flag given to the compiler. 
If the integer passed to JADAMILU top level routines are such long integer
(for instance if you use the -i8 flag), select the version of the library
with yes in the fourth column; otherwise, select the version with no.

Advanced usage
---------------

If you have problems to use one of the precompiled libraries or if the list
of compilers / operating systems does not match your requirements, then you
can manually recompile the JADAMILU library.

To do that, enter the directory /MYDIR/JADAMILU/src/

There you will find a 

       makefile 

a file called 

       user.mk

and several platform-depend suggestions in /MYDIR/JADAMILU/src/makefiles called

       makefile.ArchComp

where "ArchComp" refers to the existing platforms, mentioned earlier.
Here you can preselect you own compiler and settings. The file 
"makefile.ArchComp" is included from "makefile". 
In the easiest case you simply choose your platform and compiler from 
"user.mk". If necessary you may alter "makefile.ArchComp" make your 
private settings.
