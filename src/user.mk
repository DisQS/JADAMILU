# 1. step.
# which platform do we use?
# ILUPACK comes along with some standard settings for various compilers and
# platforms. Often enough it suffices to choose one from the list below.
# In case you do not find an acceptable configuration, you can change the
# associated "makefile.include*" configuration in "makefiles/"
# The ILUPACK libraries and some dependencies will be provided in the
# associated sub directory of "libs/"
